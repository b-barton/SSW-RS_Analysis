Scripts to analyse the Scottish Shelf Water - Reanalysis Service by Benjamin I. Barton (NOC). https://sites.google.com/view/ssw-rs/home

The required libaries can be installed in a conda environment using the environment.yml file using "conda env create -f environment.yml". 

The scripts are written in Python and use the PyFVCOM library for a lot of the processing. The version of the PyFVCOM library used was the dev branch which has additional functionality and bug fixes compared to the master branch. This can be downloaded from https://github.com/pwcazenave/PyFVCOM/tree/dev.
